            <p contenteditable="true">Many Shoominions in the Basement play and deal in all manner of Gamba activities. Some say they're determined. When a shoominion is asked to stop their gamba the reaction is hostile and even violent. The Shoominion called Confusion became hostile when they were asked being able to roll the "death" dice concerning the ongoing pandemic.</p>

                <div contenteditable="true">
                    <p>What all started as Emi_the_Frinely_Potato stating that they were sick has quickly turned into a full-blown Basement wide pandemic.</p>
                    <p>The disease seems to be spread by close contact with the infected. Namely huggies. After a shoominion has become infected they are overcome with the compulsion to spread the contagion. Outside of their own conscious will.</p>
                    <p>When basement officials were approached, they had the following to say: “The infection is spreading rapidly and it's hard to keep track, but it is believed that 6 Shoominions are currently infected. Statistically speaking, there's a 47% chance one or more will die”</p>
                    <p>The basement centre for disease control (the BCDC) had the following statement: “Uninfected Shoominions, When talking in the basement, make sure to avoid all infected people. Do not get hugged. Don't listen to them when they claim they are great huggers.”</p>
                    <p>Even as Emi is sick The basement shall expend all its energy to follow the Pandemic as it spreads. Stay safe out there Shoominions.</p>
